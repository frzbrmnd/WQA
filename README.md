# Water_Quality_Assessment

Water_Quality_Assessment is a full-stack web application developed as a freelance project for processing, analyzing, and managing water-quality information. The system combines a PHP/JavaScript frontend with a PostgreSQL database backend, and includes Python-based machine learning scripts for analyzing user-submitted environmental data.

Although originally built for a client, the project also represents my skills in environmental data processing, web development, and geospatially relevant data workflows, which align closely with my academic and research interests.

# Project Overview

The platform provides an end-to-end workflow for:

- Collecting and validating water-quality inputs

- Performing automated ML-based analysis using Python scripts

- Managing user accounts and secure authentication

- Running asynchronous AJAX operations for efficient data communication

- Storing structured environmental data in PostgreSQL

- Preparing datasets for further GIS or research-oriented processing

This project demonstrates my ability to bridge web development, database engineering, and data-driven Python analytics into a coherent system.

# Key Features

## Backend Machine Learning (Python)
A set of Python scripts inside the project performs

- Dashboard Interface
A central page for viewing and interacting with water-quality content.

- Asynchronous Backend Handling
AJAX endpoints (index_ajax_handler.php, signup_ajax_handler.php) enable fast and responsive user interactions.

- Modular PHP Backend
Reusable utility functions grouped in functions.php for clarity and extensibility.

- Clean Frontend Structure
Separate folders for styles, scripts, and images to maintain an organized layout.

- User Authentication
Registration, login, logout, and session management.
